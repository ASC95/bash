# - Parentheses expansions:
#   - See bash/1-concepts/1-language/process-control/command-substitution.sh for "(<command>)" syntax
#   - See bash/1-concepts/1-language/arithmetic-contexts/... for "((<expression>))" syntax
#   - See bash/1-concepts/1-language/arithmetic-contexts/... for "$((<expression>))" syntax
#   - etc.
# - Syntax that use parentheses, but that I don't view as parentheses expansions:
#   - See bash/1-concepts/1-language/variable-expansion/array-expansion.sh for "('elmement' 'element')" syntax
