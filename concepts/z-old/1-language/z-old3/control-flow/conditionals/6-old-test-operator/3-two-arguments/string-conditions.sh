check_if_string_is_null() {
    # - foo is set and it expands to the null string. This is NOT the case of providing one argument to [
    foo=''
    [ -z $foo ]; echo $? # 0
    # - blah is not set, so it expands to the null string. This actually turns into the case of providing one argument to [
    [ -z $blah ]; echo $? # 0
    # - "blah" is literally the string "blah" which has length greater than 0, so it isn't null
    [ -z blah ]; echo $? # 1
}

# - Use the -n unary conditional operator to return true if the string is NOT null (i.e. it has length greater than 0)
check_if_string_is_not_null() {
    [ -n '' ]; echo $? # 1
    [ -n ' ' ]; echo $? # 0
    # - This is the case of providing one argument to [, which evaluates to true since -n is not null
    [ -n ]; echo $? # 0
    # - This is the case of providing one argument to [, which evaluates to true since -n is not null. This is EXTREMELY confusing because I thought
    #   that I was evaluating whether or not $cat was null
    #   - This is why I must use the new test operator instead of the old test operator
    [ -n $cat ]; echo $? # 0
    # - cat is unset, so it expands to null. Since I double quoted the variable expansion, THIS correctly tells me that cat is indeed null
    [ -n "$cat" ]; echo $? # 1
