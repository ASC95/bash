# - When a command is used as an argument to another command, the argument command is treated as a string!
#   - This behavior is caused by the execution of the Bash parser. After Bash has evaluated quotes and performed all expansions, the last thing it
#     does is execute the actual commands. Commands are executed from left to right, so the leftmost command WILL interpret everything to the right
#     of it as an argument!

}

# - If I want to use the output of a command as an argument to another command, I need to use command substitution (a.k.a. $(<commands>) )
#    - Command substitution is a type of an expansion, so the parser evaluates the command substitution before the leftmost command executes
