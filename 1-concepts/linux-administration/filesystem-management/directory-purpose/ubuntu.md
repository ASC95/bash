- https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LinuxFilesystemTreeOverview - excellent summary of filesystem locations
# Filesystem directories summary
- /bin: contains most essential terminal commands
- /etc: contains system-wide configuration files that affect all users
- /lib: contains important dynamic libraries and kernel modules
- /opt: stores additional software packages that are NOT managed by the package manager
- /proc: contains a virtual filesystem that provides a mechanism for the kernel to send information to processes (interesting!)
- /tmp: provides temporary storage for all applications
- /usr: contains USER utilties and applications
    - This is different from /bin
- /var: similar in purpose to /tmp, except that the contents of /var persist between boots
    - /var/log contains system log files which are very useful
