- All I can say is that apparently I WON'T be able to run Octave from Splunk...
- To-do: figure out why I can't invoke oct2py when Splunk runs my Bash script that activates and calls Pythono
- Does the error persist when I use the global Python 3 installation and install oct2py?
- I can't solve this right now, I don't have time...
